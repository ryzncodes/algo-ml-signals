# AI-Powered Intraday Trading Signal Generator Documentation

## Overview

This documentation repository contains comprehensive specifications, guidelines, and reference materials for the AI-Powered Intraday Trading Signal Generator project. The system is designed to analyze BTC/USD market data using machine learning techniques to generate actionable trading signals.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- [PRD Overview](prd/README.md): Comprehensive product requirements, objectives, and success criteria

### 2. Technical Specifications
- [System Architecture](technical_specs/system_architecture.md): High-level architecture and component details
- [Backtesting Framework](technical_specs/backtesting_framework.md): Specifications for the backtesting system

### 3. Data Specifications
- [Data Specification](data/data_specification.md): Data sources, schema, collection, and processing details

### 4. Model Specifications
- [Model Specification](models/model_specification.md): ML model architecture, training, and evaluation details

### 5. Deployment Specifications
- [Deployment Specification](deployment/deployment_specification.md): Deployment architecture, processes, and operations

## Getting Started

### For Project Managers
Start with the [PRD Overview](prd/README.md) to understand the project goals, scope, and timeline.

### For Data Scientists
Begin with the [Data Specification](data/data_specification.md) and [Model Specification](models/model_specification.md) documents.

### For Engineers
Review the [System Architecture](technical_specs/system_architecture.md) and [Deployment Specification](deployment/deployment_specification.md) documents.

### For QA and Testing
