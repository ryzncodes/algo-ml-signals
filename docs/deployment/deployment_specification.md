# Deployment Specification

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the deployment architecture and processes for the AI-Powered Intraday Trading Signal Generator. It provides a comprehensive guide for deploying the system to production environments, ensuring reliability, scalability, and security.

### 1.1 Deployment Goals

The deployment strategy aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance
2. **Scalability**: Support increasing data volumes and user base
3. **Security**: Protect sensitive data and system integrity
4. **Maintainability**: Enable seamless updates and monitoring
5. **Performance**: Minimize latency for real-time signal generation

### 1.2 Deployment Approach

The system follows a microservices architecture deployed using containerization and orchestration technologies. This approach provides:

- **Isolation**: Each component runs in its own container
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of components based on demand
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation and automatic recovery
- **Flexibility**: Technology-agnostic deployment
