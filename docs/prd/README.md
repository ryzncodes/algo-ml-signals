- Implement a comprehensive backtesting framework to validate trading strategies
- Deploy a real-time signal generator that delivers actionable insights via Telegram
- Establish a continuous learning pipeline to improve model performance over time
- Maintain rigorous risk management protocols to protect capital

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio > 1.5)
- **Secondary**: Signal accuracy (> 60% for directional predictions)
- **Tertiary**: Maximum drawdown (< 15%)
