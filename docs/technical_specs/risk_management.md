# Risk Management Framework

## 1. Overview

The Risk Management Framework is a critical component of the AI-Powered Intraday Trading Signal Generator, designed to protect capital, manage exposure, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the trading strategy. This document outlines the principles, methodologies, and implementation details of the risk management system.

### 1.1 Purpose

The Risk Management Framework serves the following purposes:

1. **Capital Preservation**: Protect trading capital from significant losses
2. **Risk Control**: Manage and limit exposure to market risks
3. **Consistency**: Ensure consistent application of risk parameters
4. **Adaptability**: Adjust risk parameters based on market conditions
5. **Transparency**: Provide clear risk metrics for decision-making

### 1.2 Key Principles

The framework is built on the following key principles:

- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Optimize for risk-adjusted returns rather than absolute returns
- **Diversification**: Spread risk across different signals and timeframes
- **Position Sizing**: Scale position sizes based on conviction and volatility
- **Stop-Loss Discipline**: Implement and respect predefined exit criteria
- **Risk Budgeting**: Allocate risk across different strategies and signals

## 2. Risk Categories

### 2.1 Market Risk

Market risk refers to the potential for losses due to movements in market prices.

#### 2.1.1 Price Risk
- **Volatility Risk**: Risk from price volatility
- **Gap Risk**: Risk from price gaps between trading sessions
- **Liquidity Risk**: Risk from inability to execute at desired prices
- **Slippage Risk**: Risk from execution price differing from expected price

#### 2.1.2 Market Regime Risk
- **Trend/Range Transitions**: Risk from changing market regimes
- **Volatility Regime Shifts**: Risk from changing volatility environments
- **Correlation Breakdowns**: Risk from changing asset correlations

### 2.2 Model Risk

Model risk refers to the potential for losses due to model limitations or failures.

#### 2.2.1 Overfitting Risk
- **In-Sample Overfitting**: Models performing well on training data but poorly on new data
- **Feature Selection Bias**: Selecting features that worked historically by chance
- **Hyperparameter Overfitting**: Optimizing hyperparameters too specifically to historical data

#### 2.2.2 Model Drift Risk
- **Feature Drift**: Changes in the statistical properties of input features
- **Concept Drift**: Changes in the relationship between features and target
- **Performance Degradation**: Gradual decline in model performance over time

    # Return the maximum of the two
    return max(initial_stop, trailing_stop)
```

### 4.3 Take-Profit Mechanisms

Take-profit mechanisms define exit criteria to secure profits on individual trades.

        if entry_price > stop_loss_price:  # Long position
            take_profit = entry_price + (risk * ratio)
        else:  # Short position
            take_profit = entry_price - (risk * ratio)
